# An Open Source Algorithm for the Automatic Labelling of Motion Capture Markers using Deep Learning

An algorithm that uses machine learning to automatically label optical motion capture markers. The algorithm can be trained on existing data or simulated marker trajectories. Data and code is provided to generate the simulated trajectories for custom marker sets.
